# Carleton University SYSC 2006 Labs (Winter 2025)

* Lab test file to check for compiler is included
* Completed: Lab 1 (setup), Lab 2, Lab 3

### Lab 2 - Introduction to C
* Using simple imperative programming constructs (conditional statements and loops) to implement C functions
* Test Driven Development (TDD), implemented test cases for all functions defined in this section
* Exercises: alarm clock, FizzBuzz (count and replace), check prime number, sum of an even number in a range

### Lab 3 - Functions and Recursion
* Using simple testing framework *sput* to automate the process of testing C functions
* Learned how to read test functions that use *sput* and interpreted the output when the tests were executed
* Part 1 -> related to becoming comfortable with *sput*
* Part 2 -> related to C functions; function composition
